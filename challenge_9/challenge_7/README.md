Find The Missing Number
======
Idea
------
Given a list of numbers from 0 to N-1, your job is to find the missing number. Your program should take in a list of integers and return a single integer (the missing number).

Notes:

* The test cases will not be sorted
* You should not sort them
* Your solution should use O(1) space and complete in O(N) time
* Only one number will be missing.

Example: Given the list [0,1,2,4], your program should return the number 3

Given the list [1,2,3], your program should return the 0.

Note: This is a popular interview question. Bloomberg in particular, really likes this question. 

Testing
------
Testing for this challenge is fairly straight forward. Simply create a list of size N, filled with integers from 0 to N-1, with one integer missing.
